                <p>By better understanding how sweetness affects the quality perception of wine experts, wineries may be able to tailor their wines better based on popular customer tastes and hencd increasing sales. This project aims to study the difference in the level of residual sugar, the main chemical component that adds sweetness, and its effects on wine quality. Residual sugar is the amount of sugar from natural grapes that is leftover in a bottle of wine after the fermentation process is completed. During the fermentation process, sugar is converted to alcohol with the help of yeast, and winemakers can choose at which point to terminate the fermentation process before all the sugar gets consumed. This decision could affect both the levels of residual sugar and the alcohol concentration. Therefore, the research question is <b><i>Does sweeter non-sparkling wine lead to better quality review by wine experts?</i></b></p>

                <h4 id="algorithm">Statistical vs. Practical Significance</h4>
                <p>We obtained the coefficient estimate of the effect of residual sugar on wine quality to be -0.014 for the base linear regression model with a p-value less than 0.001, indicating that for every unit increase in gram per Liter (g/L) of residual sugar, there will be an approximate decrease of 0.014 in expert rated wine quality.
                <br>It is also important to evaluate the practical significance of our results. Given that with a large sample size of over 100 samples in both the train and test dataset, our coefficient estimate is 0.014, which is one hundredth of a unit in Likert scale. Based on our model, wine with no residual sugar will receive a 5.883 grade in rating by wine experts. With an unit increase of g/L for residual sugar, our model tells us that we will observe a -0.014 decrease in rating. The typical range of residual sugar in wine that ranges from 0 g/L to 120 g/L. This means that wine quality effect due to residual sugar would decrease 1.68 grade in rating when increasing residual sugar to 120 g/L. The drastic changes in the manufacturing process to achieve a 120 g/L to 0 g/L reduction in residual sugar will at most lead to a 1.68 degree of increase in wine quality rating. This leads us to conclude that although our model was able to establish a significant causal relationship between residual sugar and wine quality, the effect size is really small, hence no practical significance can be evaluated.
                <br>We understand that it is easier to achieve statistical significant results given our large sample and small standard error. Therefore, the reason that our coefficient estimate is significant could simply be due to having a large sample size.
                </p>

                <h4 id="algorithm">Discussion</h4>
                <p>Despite our proposed causal theory that sweeter non-sparkling wines lead to better quality review by wine experts, analysis of our dataset showed the opposite. In fact, residual sugar concentration has a negative and significant effect (&beta;<sub>1</sub> = -0.019, p < 0.01) on wine quality as reviewed by wine experts when fitting test dataset using our linear regression model
                    <br><center><math>
                        quality = &beta;<sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub>(residual sugar) + &beta;<sub>2</sub>(citric acid) + &beta;<sub>3</sub>(citric acid<sup>2</sup>) + &beta;<sub>4</sub>(climates) + &beta;<sub>5</sub>(NaCl) + &epsilon;
                    </math></center>
                Our results disprove the theory that simply adding sugar will make the wine quality score higher. There could exist additional complex relationships among many of the variables that we have not found. Thus, increasing the residual sugar may inadvertently affect other variables in the winemaking process, and therefore negatively affect the quality.
                <br>The combination of a statistical significant result and a small effect size could indicate that the quality of wine may be driven by a myriad of other multiple characteristics and the sweetness of white wine may not be a significantly important factor. Our model has the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.073. This indicates that only 7.3% of the wine quality variation can be attributed to the model. As this value is relatively small, it does not adequately explain the relationship.
                <br>It was also determined that different types of wine have different intended levels or ranges of residual sugar. This means that various types have been evaluated over many years and a certain recommended balance of the variables involved in the winemaking have been achieved with a recommended amount of residual sugar. It is possible that many consumers prefer types of wine that are sweeter in general, but as our study involved only white wine, this does not mean that only increasing the residual sugar in that type of wine will increase the quality. Furthermore, since our dataset was collected more than a decade ago and changes in consumer preferences could have happened more recently. Therefore, we could conduct follow up analysis on looking at the causal relationship between residual sugar and quality for more recent wines produced from US wineries.
                <br>Our recommendation is for winemakers to refrain from simply increasing residual sugar in the hopes of making the wine receive a higher quality rating, but rather engage in research on their specific type of wine, and a large number of variables that may affect the flavor to achieve a superior and more desirable product. Increasing the residual sugar alone is not recommended to achieve a more desirable and higher quality wine.
